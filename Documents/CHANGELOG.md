# Changelog

## Version: Feb 25 Playtest Build

As public playtests are ongoing, we will start sharing our changelog with community. **But, because we are not released we don't want to spoil the game.** We will therefore not include notes on new items, mechanics, or systems that we haven't talked about or players have not yet seen. This time the focus is on updates and changes to features since the last playtest in December.

While the following text has some spoilers removed, for purists all updates on this channel will carry a spoilers flag until launch.
