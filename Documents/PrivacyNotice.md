# With which third parties we disclose personal data

Where relevant and necessary, we provide personal data to the following third parties:

- Our third-party service providers who support us with providing our Services and conducting our business, including Steam and AWS. This means that your personal data is processed by third party vendors for website and application development, hosting and maintenance, data hosting and cloud (storage) services, backup services, data analysis, information security services, technical infrastructure services, customer support services, and marketing services.
- Other parties with whom you choose to share your personal data with, depending on how you use our Services. For instance, social media platforms or other platforms (such as platforms used for customer support), or our business partners.

# Cookies

Our Services are currently only available through Steam. Steam may use Cookies to store and access data on your device to help its websites and apps work. Please refer to Steam’s Cookie Policy for an up-to-date overview of the use of these Cookies on your device(s).

# How we transfer personal data internationally

We try to process your data within the EU as much as possible. Sometimes it is necessary to transfer your data outside the EU to a country which does not provide the same level of data protection as is provided in the EU, for example, if a third-party service provider is located outside Europe. When we transfer your data outside the EU, we ensure that this is done in accordance with applicable data protection laws and that the protection of your data is adequately safeguarded. We do this, for example, by concluding agreements with third party service providers based on the EU standard contractual clauses for the international transfer of personal data. If you would like to receive more information on the safeguards taken, please contact us via [privacy@pp.studio](mailto:privacy@pp.studio).

# How we protect and store personal data

We have implemented physical, technical and organisational security measures to protect your personal data as required by applicable laws. These measures are aimed at ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of your personal data, for instance by ensuring that only authorised employees have access to your personal data, and to protect it against unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, use or disclosure, or access. We evaluate and update these measures on a regular basis. Please be aware that no information system can be 100% secure. This means that we cannot guarantee the absolute security or availability of your personal data.

We will retain your personal data for the duration of your interaction with our Services, unless a shorter retention period is required by applicable laws or the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which the data was obtained. Once you no longer interact with our Services, we will retain your personal data for the period of time that enables us to:

- fulfil our legal obligations, including legal retention periods;
- initiate, investigate or defend against legal claims;
- address your questions, requests or complaints; and
- keep our records for analysis and audit purposes.

# How to exercise your rights

We respect the rights granted to you under applicable data protection laws. Depending on your location and such applicable laws, these may include the right to access your personal data that we hold about you, to rectify or erase certain personal data, to restrict processing of your personal data and to get an electronic copy of your personal data for purposes of transmitting it to another company. These rights may be subject to certain limitations or restrictions as allowed or imposed by applicable laws, if this is the case we will let you know in our communications with you.

In addition, where we rely on our legitimate interest to process your personal data, you have the right to object to such processing, wholly or partly, on grounds related to your particular situation and in accordance with the laws applicable to you. For instance, depending on your country this may include a right to opt-out to marketing communications via an opt-out link in the respective marketing message.

Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

To exercise your rights, please send an email to [privacy@pp.studio](mailto:privacy@pp.studio).

You are also entitled to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
