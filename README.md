## Playtest Sign-Up Support

Sign-ups for our playtests open on specific dates and operate on a first-come, first-served basis. RSVP to our Discord events to receive notifications when sign-ups go live. All playtest sign-ups happen exclusively [in our official Discord](https://go.pp.studio/Discord), where we:
1. Verify participant eligibility.
2. Distribute Steam keys for game access.
3. Provide important resources such as our playtest survey and channels for sharing content during playtests.
Note: During busy periods it can take a few minutes for our playtest Discord bot to give access to these channels.

### Who is eligible to participate?
We have two requirements for playtest participants:
- You must be a member of our official Discord.
- You must have a Steam account that has been active for more than one year.

### I'm eligible—can I prepare anything before sign-ups open?
To ensure a smooth sign-up experience, please:
- Take note of your Steam ID number:
  - Open Steam, select "Account details," and find your Steam ID number below your username.
- Set your Steam account privacy to public at the time of registration. Please note that it may take a few minutes for Steam to process this change.

### I signed up, but can't find my Steam key.
Visit the "view-my-key" channel on Discord and click the provided button; your key should appear.

If you cannot access this channel, please see the section "I signed up, but I don't have access to playtester resources on Discord." If you continue having trouble, reach out to @PPYaachts via DM on Discord.

### I have my Steam key—how do I redeem it?
Redeem your Steam key through your Steam library or by visiting [this link](https://store.steampowered.com/account/registerkey).

### I signed up, but I don't have access to playtester resources on Discord.
After you've signed up and received your key, you should gain access to Discord channels containing playtest resources, including the playtest survey and content-sharing channels.

Occasionally, it can take our bot up to 20 minutes to grant access. If you still lack access after this period, please contact @PPYaachts via DM on Discord.

### I've reviewed all of this but still need help—who can I contact?
Please reach out to @PPYaachts via DM on Discord. Playtest sign-up periods can be busy, so there might be a brief wait before receiving assistance.
